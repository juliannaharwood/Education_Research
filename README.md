# Scoring Tests
## Used to assess students' learning.

RawScoring and SpecialScoring are used to score tests given to introductory physics classes at the beginning and end of each semester. The goal is to understand 
how much students have learned over the course of the class. RawScoring calculates the raw score of the test (how many questions the student answered correctly) and SpecialScoring utilizes a slightly different scoring
technique which is considered by some to be a better way to assess a student’s knowledge. These scripts also output the 
mean pre and post test scores, their standard deviations, the mean Hake’s Gain (the difference between post and pre test scores 
divided by the pretest score) as well as it’s standard deviation. If data is grouped by section of the class, the scripts will also output all of the values by section as well as TukeyHSD post hoc tests to test for significant differences between sections.
